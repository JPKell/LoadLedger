# Lockfiles

Exact, hash-verified pins for this repository's **own** CI and release pipeline, required by
Packaging and Release Standards §4 and
Security Standards §11.

| File | Contents | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.lock` | Runtime dependencies plus the `dev` extra: the whole test, lint, type and boundary toolchain | Every blocking CI job |
| `release.in` / `release.lock` | The build and publish chain (`build`, `hatchling`, `twine`) | `release.yml`, and CI's `build` job |

## What these are not

They do **not** define what a consumer installs. `pip install loadledger` resolves the compatible
ranges in `pyproject.toml`; a library that shipped pinned runtime dependencies would be
un-coinstallable with the rest of the suite. These files exist so that a green build stays green:
without them every CI run re-resolves, and a new `ruff` or `mypy` release can change the result
with no commit to explain it — and `pip-audit` would be auditing today's resolution rather than
what the build actually used.

`ci.lock` is short by suite standards, and deliberately: `loadledger`'s only runtime dependency is
`baseaicore`, whose own dependency count is zero (gold standards §2). Everything else in the file
is the development toolchain.

## Regenerating

Run after any change to `pyproject.toml`'s dependencies or `dev` extra, and commit the result:

```bash
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile --strip-extras --extra dev --generate-hashes \
    --output-file requirements/ci.lock pyproject.toml
pip-compile --strip-extras --generate-hashes \
    --output-file requirements/release.lock requirements/release.in
```

`uv pip compile` is the sanctioned alternative (Security Standards §11).

Both files were generated with **pip-tools 7.6.1**, which reconstructs `--no-index` into the header
comment where earlier versions did not. That flag is part of the recorded command, not part of the
resolution: the locks were resolved against PyPI, and re-running the commands above reproduces
them. `release.lock` is byte-identical to WeightsDB's, MirrorWall's and ModelRack's below the
header, which is the check that the chain really is reproducible rather than merely pinned.

## Interpreter

Resolved on Python 3.13. Every pin's `requires-python` admits 3.12, and no pin is
CPython-ABI-specific, so the same lock installs on both supported versions; the 3.14 early-warning
job deliberately resolves from ranges instead, because pinning a version that has no 3.14 wheels
would defeat the purpose of an early warning.

## Coverage measures the installed package, not the checkout

CI installs the built distribution (`pip install . --no-deps`), not an editable checkout, so
`[tool.coverage.run] source` in `pyproject.toml` names the **importable package** rather than
`src/loadledger`. A path-based source reports 0 % against a non-editable install — the tests all
pass, nothing is measured, and the coverage gate fails with a number that looks like a catastrophe
instead of a configuration error.
